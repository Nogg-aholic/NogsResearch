## New Stuff

- Added a "new user tutorial" to the HUB and MAM
  - The queue drag-and-drop icons and queue trash can are now highlighted when you first open the HUB/MAM
  - Hovering over them for long enough will dismiss the tutorial
  - You can reset the tutorial state in the mod configs

## Known Bugs

- Reordering the queue as a client can sometimes cause entries to duplicate, but the system will correct itself when the queue is processed, so this is a visual problem only
- Adding and removing items from the queue in a specific order can bypass MAM research tree dependencies
- When opened through sources other than the HUB Terminal (ex. the Remote Research Module in PowerSuit), the HUB interface can be inoperable until you use the regular HUB Terminal again
