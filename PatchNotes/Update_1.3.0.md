## New Stuff

- Hover over the Science Power readout in the HUB to see a graph visualizing the effect Science Points have on research time.
  - Thanks AngryBeaver for the idea!

## Changed Stuff

- Modified the Researcher HUB section help tooltip to mention the roles of Researchers and Research Accelerators
  - Thanks mushierroom for bringing up that this was unclear

## Known Bugs

- Reordering the queue as a client can sometimes cause entries to duplicate, but the system will correct itself when the queue is processed, so this is a visual problem only
- Adding and removing items from the queue in a specific order can bypass MAM research tree dependencies
- When opened through sources other than the HUB Terminal (ex. the Remote Research Module in PowerSuit), the HUB interface can be inoperable until you use the regular HUB Terminal again
